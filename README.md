# tic-tac-toe

This assignment from The Odin Project is centered around developing good coding habits when creating new objects.

The main goal is to have as little global code as possible.  Attributes and methods should be kept within factories and modules.  This will make the code easier to understand and maintain, and will also add a layer of security from malicious users. 

This tic-tac-toe app is an impregnable fortress of lighthearted amusement.
